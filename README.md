## Introduction

### Project Overview

The Weather Detection System is an IoT-based project designed to monitor real-time environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. Using an Arduino microcontroller connected to sensors, the system collects weather data, processes it, and transmits it to a web server via a Wi-Fi module (ESP8266).

The data is displayed on a user-friendly website through API integration, providing a dynamic and interactive interface for users to visualize weather metrics. This project demonstrates the integration of IoT devices with web technologies to create scalable and efficient solutions for real-time environmental monitoring, highlighting the capabilities of sensor technology, IoT frameworks, and web development.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop an IoT-based solution for real-time weather monitoring. By leveraging sensors and wireless communication technologies, the system aims to provide accurate and timely weather data, which can be accessed remotely via a web interface. This can be used for various applications, including:

Environmental monitoring: To track and study weather patterns for research or forecasting.
Smart agriculture: Helping farmers monitor weather conditions to optimize crop management.
Home automation: Integrating weather data into smart home systems for better energy management.
Disaster management: Providing critical real-time data for weather-related emergency response.
Overall, the system aims to improve accessibility to weather information and enhance decision-making based on accurate, real-time data.
